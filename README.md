================

:exclamation: Change 'MLB', 'ROM', 'SystemSerialNumber' and 'SystemUUID' number to a valid value!

:exclamation: I've personally tested most of the functions but there is no guarantee that everything works as expected!

:exclamation: Latest AMD Vanilla patch included (as of 30/04/2020).
